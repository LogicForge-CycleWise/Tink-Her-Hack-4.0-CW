# [CycleWise] 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: [LogicForge]

### Team Members
- Member 1: [Ann Rose Shaju] - [LBSITW]
- Member 2: [Angela Fredy] - [LBSITW]

### Hosted Project Link
[mention your project hosted link here]

### Project Description
[CycleWise is a cycle-aware wellbeing and productivity app that adapts guidance to a user’s menstrual phase and energy levels. It combines a structured wellbeing framework with AI-powered personalization to support everyday planning.]

### The Problem statement
[Many students and young women struggle with fluctuating energy, focus, and mood across their menstrual cycle, but most planning and productivity tools ignore these changes. As a result, users often feel unproductive or guilty without understanding that these shifts are normal and cyclical.]

### The Solution
[CycleWise bridges the gap between period tracking and daily planning by offering cycle-aware wellbeing and productivity guidance. It uses a structured framework and optional AI personalization to deliver actionable insights while remaining accessible and non-medical.]
